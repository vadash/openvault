Since you are implementing **Keyword Match Weight**, you absolutely need to expose the **Vector Similarity Weight** and the **Similarity Threshold** in the UI.

Currently, `vectorSimilarityWeight` (default 15) and `vectorSimilarityThreshold` (default 0.5) exist in `src/constants.js`, but **they are not in your `settings_panel.html`**.

If you add Keyword Weight without exposing Vector Weight, users won't be able to balance the "Hybrid Search" (e.g., if Keywords are overpowering Semantic search, they can't turn Semantic up).

Here is the plan to expose these essential "tuner" knobs.

### Phase 1: Update HTML Template (`templates/settings_panel.html`)

**Context:** We need a new "Scoring Weights" section inside the "Configuration" tab. This should group the new Keyword slider with the existing (but hidden) Vector sliders.

**Prompt for Claude Code:**
```text
I need to expose scoring weights in the UI.
Read `templates/settings_panel.html`.

In the "Configuration" tab (`data-tab="configuration"`), find the "Advanced Parameters" details block.
Inside that block, add a new section (visual divider or headers) labeled "Scoring & Weights".

Add the following 3 sliders:

1.  **Vector Weight:**
    - Label: "Semantic Match Weight"
    - ID: `openvault_vector_weight`
    - Range: 0 to 50
    - Step: 1
    - Default: 15

2.  **Keyword Weight** (The one we just planned):
    - Label: "Keyword Match Weight"
    - ID: `openvault_keyword_weight`
    - Range: 0 to 10
    - Step: 0.1
    - Default: 1.0

3.  **Similarity Threshold:**
    - Label: "Semantic Threshold"
    - ID: `openvault_vector_threshold`
    - Range: 0 to 1
    - Step: 0.05
    - Default: 0.5
    - Hint: "Minimum similarity required to apply semantic bonus"
```

### Phase 2: Bind Logic (`src/ui/settings.js`)

**Context:** Connect these new HTML inputs to the settings object.

**Prompt for Claude Code:**
```text
Read `src/ui/settings.js`.
In the `bindUIElements` function, add bindings for the new scoring sliders.

1.  Bind `openvault_vector_weight` to `settings.vectorSimilarityWeight`.
    - Add a value display span `#openvault_vector_weight_value`.

2.  Bind `openvault_keyword_weight` to `settings.keywordMatchWeight`.
    - Add a value display span `#openvault_keyword_weight_value`.

3.  Bind `openvault_vector_threshold` to `settings.vectorSimilarityThreshold`.
    - Add a value display span `#openvault_vector_threshold_value`.

Ensure `updateUI` is also updated to load these values from `settings` into the inputs on startup.
```

### Phase 3: Pass to Worker (`src/retrieval/scoring.js`)

**Context:** Ensure these dynamic settings actually reach the worker thread.

**Prompt for Claude Code:**
```text
Read `src/retrieval/scoring.js`.

In the `runWorkerScoring` function, look at the `postMessage` payload.
In the `settings` object sent to the worker, ensure the following are passed dynamically from the `settings` argument (not hardcoded):

- `vectorSimilarityThreshold`
- `vectorSimilarityWeight`
- `keywordMatchWeight`
```

### Summary of What You Are Building

You are effectively building a **Hybrid Search Tuner**.

| Setting | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Semantic Match Weight** | "Vibes" search. Finds "Canine" when you search "Dog". High values make the AI "intuitive" but sometimes loose. |
| **Keyword Match Weight** | "Exact" search. Finds "Project Chimera" exactly. High values make the AI precise but rigid. |
| **Semantic Threshold** | The "Noise Filter". If set to 0.7, only *very* closely related memories get a vector bonus. If set to 0.3, almost everything gets a small bonus. |
